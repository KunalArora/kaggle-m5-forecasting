### Some general information regarding the competition:
The [Makridakis competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makridakis_Competitions) (or M-competitions), organised by forecasting expert Spyros Makridakis, aim to provide a better understanding and advancement of forecasting methodology by comparing the performance of different methods in solving a well-defined, real-world problem. The first M-competition was held in 1982. The [forth competition (M4)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301128) ran in 2018 and featured “100,000 time series and 61 forecasting methods” (source in link). According to forecasting researcher and practitioner Rob Hyndman the M-competitions “have had an enormous influence on the field of forecasting. They focused attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models”. This empirical approach is very similar to Kaggle’s trade-mark way of having the best machine learning algorithms engage in intense competition on diverse datasets. M5 is the first M-competition to be held on Kaggle.

### Goal
Teams have been challenged to predict sales data provided by the retail giant Walmart 28 days into the future. This competition will run in 2 tracks: In addition to forecasting the values themselves in the Forecasting competition, we are simultaneously tasked to estimate the uncertainty of our predictions in the Uncertainty Distribution competition. Both competitions will have the same 28 day forecast horizon.
